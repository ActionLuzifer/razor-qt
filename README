Using:

=== Tiling ===

Tiling is undergoing many changes now and maybe will in the future...
projects/razor-qt)

Right now tiling is working als follows:

middle-click on the app-title puts the window on half of the screen. the half which is used, is determined through the window position. (i.e. a window in the left half somewhere will get the left half of the screen).

middle-click a tiled-window on the title again, will make it switch screen-half (left->right and otherwise).

middle-klicking on the "X" symbol does tile the window to a quarter on the right screen-half (up / down is determined again by window position if its "more up" or "more down") 

middle-clickin on the "updown"-icon on the top-left-window corner does quarter-tile the window and put it on the left screen-half. (up or down is also determined by original window position)

=== Favourites Menu ===

You can add/remove applictions with the "manager"-app, available from the mainlauncher. 
just do an "add-program" and select category "Favourite"
