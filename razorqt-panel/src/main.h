 * @author Christopher "VdoP" Regali
 * @version 0.1-65 (MAJOR.MINOR-SVNREV)
 * @section Introduction
 * Razor-qt started as a simple modification of the antico-DE.
 * After writing an xdg-manager for it and cleaning up some of the code it came to me, that with all this cleanup-work i could just write it on my own.
 * Also my knowledge of the Xlib was not good enough to fix some of the flaws i found, so i decided to just use a windowmanager,
 * that already works very well (Openbox) and port my work as panel / desktop, etc there.
 *
 * @section Goals
 * The goal is to make a lightweight desktop-environment.
 *  *) Doing only  a few things but doing them well
 *  *) Creating a productive environment to work with
